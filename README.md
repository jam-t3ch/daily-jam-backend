### What pain point does this project solve?

* Trying to solve boredom and lack of jam-based content in peopleâ€™s lives. People should have an amusing hub to also get useful information. Allow users to find news, weather, food recipes, up-to-hour traffic info, and more in an enjoyable, jam-themed (purple-ish color theme/palette), intuitive format.

### Why should we care about your product?

* In an over-stimulating world demanding our attention is spread too thin, Daily Jam app will stimulate the users mental taste-buds and leave them satisfied.
